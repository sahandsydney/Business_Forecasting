### Integrating Time Series Forecasting, NLP, and Financial Analysis for Optimal Investment Strategy: A Case Study on Adani Ports
In today's dynamic and competitive business landscape, accurate business forecasting and insightful financial analysis play a crucial role in decision-making processes and the overall success of companies. This research project aims to provide valuable financial advice to startups and companies facing challenges by leveraging the power of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, even with limited financial data and resources.

The focus of this research is on conducting a comprehensive business analysis of Adani Ports, a subsidiary of the Adani Group, a prominent conglomerate company, spanning the past 18 years. By applying time series forecasting techniques to Adani Ports' financial statements and employing natural language processing (NLP) on news headlines, the research aims to deliver meaningful insights and recommendations regarding investment opportunities and potential shortcomings.

One common challenge faced by startups and struggling companies is the limited availability of historical data. However, by examining Adani Ports' extensive financial data, this research project aims to develop an effective methodology that can be applied to organizations within the Adani Group and beyond, even with similar data limitations.

The research project integrates ML and AI techniques to derive valuable financial insights from the available data, leading to strategic recommendations. The specific techniques used include multivariate time series forecasting using LSTM to analyze Adani Ports' financial statements and predict future trends. Additionally, sentiment analysis is performed using a fine-tuned version of the FinBERT model to extract valuable insights from news headlines.

By integrating financial data with NLP analysis, this research project aims to provide a holistic understanding of the external factors impacting company performance. The findings will offer Adani Ports and other companies within the Adani Group valuable financial advice, including recommendations on optimal investment locations and timing for maximum benefits.
