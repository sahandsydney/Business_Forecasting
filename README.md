Integrating Time Series Forecasting, NLP, and Financial Analysis for Optimal Investment Strategy: A Case Study on Adani Ports
In today's dynamic and competitive business landscape, effective utilization of business forecasting and financial analysis techniques is crucial for a company's decision-making process and overall success. This research project aims to provide financial advice to startups and companies facing challenges by leveraging machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, even with limited financial data and resources. The focus is on conducting a comprehensive business analysis of Adani Ports, a subsidiary of the Adani Group, a prominent conglomerate company, spanning the past 18 years. By applying time series forecasting techniques to Adani Ports' financial statements and employing natural language processing (NLP) on news headlines, the research aims to deliver valuable insights and recommendations regarding investment opportunities and potential shortcomings. Limited historical data availability is a common challenge faced by startups and struggling companies. Through the examination of Adani Ports' extensive financial data, this research project aims to develop an effective methodology that can be applied to organizations within the Adani Group and beyond, with similar limitations. By utilizing ML and AI techniques, meaningful financial insights can be derived from the available data, leading to strategic recommendations. The research project involves the application of multivariate time series forecasting technique using LSTM to analyze Adani Ports' financial statements and predict future trends. Furthermore, sentiment analysis using a finetuned FinBERT model is employed to extract valuable insights from news headlines. By integrating financial data with NLP analysis, a holistic understanding of the external factors impacting company performance is achieved. The findings of this research project will provide Adani Ports and other companies within the Adani Group with valuable financial advice, including recommendations on optimal investment locations and timing for maximum benefits
